## What is Mockingbird?

Mockingbird is a Swift mocking framework that lets you throw away your hand-written mocks and write clean,
readable tests.

- **Expansive coverage of Swift language features**
  - Mock classes and protocols in a single line of code
  - Support for generics, inheritance, static members, nested classes, type aliasing, etc.
- **Seamless integration with Xcode projects**
  - Automatic discovery of source and dependency files
  - Handling of external types from third-party libraries
- **Convenient testing API**
  - Clear stubbing and verification error messages
  - Support for asynchronous code, in order verification, default return value stubbing, etc.

### Under the Hood

Mockingbird consists of two main components: the _generator_ and the _testing framework_. Before each test bundle
compilation, configurable mock objects are created by implementing protocols and subclassing classes. The testing
framework hooks into the generated code and provides APIs for mocking, stubbing, and verification.

### A Simple Example

```swift
protocol Bird {
  var canFly: Bool { get }
  func fly()
}

class Tree {
  let bird: Bird
  
  init(with bird: Bird) {
    self.bird = bird
  }
  
  func shake() {
    guard bird.canFly else { return }
    bird.fly()
  }
}

func testShakingTreeCausesBirdToFly() {
  // Given a tree with a bird that can fly
  let bird = mock(Bird.self)
  let tree = Tree(with: bird)
  given(bird.getCanFly()) ~> true
  
  // When the tree is shaken
  tree.shake()
  
  // Then the bird flies away
  verify(bird.fly()).wasCalled()
}
```

## Installation

### CocoaPods

Add the framework to a test target in your `Podfile`, making sure to include the `use_frameworks!` option.

```ruby
target 'MyTestTarget' do
  use_frameworks!
  pod 'MockingbirdFramework', '~> 0.11'
end
```

Initialize the pod.

```bash
$ pod install
```

Then install the CLI.

```bash
$ cd Pods/MockingbirdFramework
$ make install-prebuilt
```

### Carthage

Add the framework to your `Cartfile`.

```
github "birdrides/mockingbird" ~> 0.11
```

Build the framework using Carthage and [link it to your test target](https://github.com/birdrides/mockingbird/wiki/Linking-Test-Targets), making
sure to add the framework to a Copy Files build phase with the destination set to `Frameworks`.

```bash
$ carthage update
```

Then install the CLI.

```bash
$ cd Carthage/Checkouts/mockingbird
$ make install-prebuilt
```

### Swift Package Manager

Add `https://github.com/birdrides/mockingbird` as a dependency and link it to your test target.

Then download and install the
[latest CLI from Releases](https://github.com/birdrides/mockingbird/releases/download/0.11.1/Mockingbird.pkg).

### From Source

Clone the repository and build the `MockingbirdFramework` scheme for the desired platform. Drag the built 
`Mockingbird.framework` product into your project and 
[link it to your test target](https://github.com/birdrides/mockingbird/wiki/Linking-Test-Targets).

```bash
$ git clone https://github.com/birdrides/mockingbird.git
$ cd mockingbird
$ open Mockingbird.xcodeproj
```

Then build and install the CLI.

```bash
$ make install
```

## Setup

Use the CLI to configure a test target, listing all source targets that should generate mocks before each build. Below,
mock types will be generated for the `Bird` app target and the `BirdManagers` framework target, which can then be
used in `BirdTests`.

```bash
$ mockingbird install \
  --target BirdTests \
  --sources Bird BirdManagers
```

Need to [set up your project manually](https://github.com/birdrides/mockingbird/wiki/Manual-Setup)?

### System Framework Compatibility

For basic compatibility with the Swift standard library and other system frameworks, download the latest
[starter supporting source files](https://github.com/birdrides/mockingbird/releases/download/0.11.1/MockingbirdSupport.zip)
and place the `MockingbirdSupport` folder in the root directory of your project. Note that supporting source files
should not be imported into Xcode or added to any targets. See [Supporting Source Files](#supporting-source-files)
for more information.

<details><summary>Upcoming changes in Mockingbird 0.12.0</summary>

For basic compatibility with system frameworks and types defined outside of your project, download the latest starter
supporting source files. Note that supporting source files should not be imported into Xcode or added to any targets.
See [Supporting Source Files](#supporting-source-files) for more information.

```bash
$ mockingbird download starter-pack
```

</details>

### Excluding Files

You can exclude unwanted or problematic sources from being mocked by adding a `.mockingbird-ignore` file. 
Mockingbird follows the same pattern format as [`.gitignore`](https://git-scm.com/docs/gitignore#_pattern_format) 
and scopes ignore files to their enclosing directory.

## Usage

Example projects demonstrating basic usage of Mockingbird:

- [CocoaPods tutorial + example project](/Examples/iOSMockingbirdExample-CocoaPods)
- [Carthage tutorial + example project](/Examples/iOSMockingbirdExample-Carthage)

### Mocking

Mock types can be passed in place of the original type and are suffixed with `Mock`. Avoid explicitly coercing mock
types into their supertype, as this breaks stubbing and verification.

#### Protocol Mocks

Note that the initialized mock type is `BirdMock` instead of `Bird`.

```swift
let bird: BirdMock = mock(Bird.self)  // The concrete type is `BirdMock`
let inferredBird = mock(Bird.self)    // but type inference also works
```

#### Class Mocks

Initialize concrete class mocks using the `initialize` method. Keep in mind that class mocks rely on subclassing
which has certain limitations, so consider using protocol mocks whenever possible.

```swift
class Bird {
  let name: String
  init(named name: String) { self.name = name }
}
let bird = mock(Bird.self).initialize(named: "Ryan")
```

### Stubbing

Stubbing allows you to define a custom value to return when a mocked method is called.

```swift
given(bird.getName()) ~> "Ryan"
```

#### Methods with Parameters

You can use an [argument matcher](#argument-matching) when stubbing methods with parameters. Stubs added 
later have precedence over those added earlier, so stubs containing specific matchers should be added last.

```swift
given(bird.canChirp(volume: any())) ~> false    // Matches any volume
given(bird.canChirp(volume: notNil())) ~> true  // Matches any non-nil volume
given(bird.canChirp(volume: 10)) ~> false       // Matches volume = 10
```

#### Properties

Stub properties with their getter and setter methods.

```swift
given(bird.getName()) ~> "Ryan"
given(bird.setName(any())) ~> { print($0) }
```

Getters can be stubbed to automatically save and return values.

```swift
given(bird.getName()) ~> lastSetValue(initial: "Ryan")
bird.name = "Sterling"
print(bird.name)  // Prints "Sterling"
```

#### Complex Stubs and Throwing Errors

Use a closure to implement complex stubs that contain logic or that interact with arguments. 

```swift
given(bird.chirp(volume: any(), callback: any())) ~> { volume, callback in
  callback(volume * 2)
}
```

Closures also allow for stubbing methods that can throw errors.

```swift
given(bird.chirp(volume: any())) ~> { volume in
  if volume > 42 {
    throw BirdError.invalidVolume
  }
}
```

#### Relaxed Stubbing with Default Values (0.12.0)

Mocks are strict by default, meaning that calls to unstubbed methods will trigger a test failure. Methods returning
`Void` do not need to be stubbed in strict mode.

```swift
let bird = mock(Bird.self)
print(bird.name)  // Fails because `bird.getName()` is not stubbed
bird.fly()        // Okay because `fly()` has a `Void` return type
```

To return default values for unstubbed methods, use a `ValueProvider` with the initialized mock. Default values
have a lower precedence than values returned from concrete stubs.

```swift
let valueProvider = ValueProvider().register("Ryan", for: String.self)
let bird = mock(Bird.self)
useDefaultValues(from: valueProvider, on: bird)
print(bird.name)  // Prints "Ryan"

// Values from concrete stubs have a higher precedence 
given(bird.getName()) ~> "Sterling"
print(bird.name)  // Prints "Sterling"
```

Mockingbird provides several preset value providers which are guaranteed to be backwards compatible.

```
.standardProvider
├── .collectionsProvider
├── .primitivesProvider
├── .basicsProvider
├── .geometryProvider
├── .stringsProvider
└── .datesProvider
```

```swift
let bird = mock(Bird.self)
useDefaultValues(from: .standardProvider, on: bird)
print(bird.name)  // Prints ""
```

#### Sequence of Values (0.12.0)

Methods that return a different value each time can be stubbed with a sequence of values. The last value will be used
for all subsequent invocations.

```swift
given(bird.getName()) ~> sequence(of: "Ryan", "Sterling")
print(bird.name)  // Prints "Ryan"
print(bird.name)  // Prints "Sterling"
print(bird.name)  // Prints "Sterling"
```

### Verification

Verification lets you assert that a mock received a particular invocation during its lifetime.

```swift
verify(bird.fly()).wasCalled()
```

Verifying doesn’t remove recorded invocations, so it’s safe to call verify multiple times (even if not recommended).

```swift
verify(bird.fly()).wasCalled()  // If this succeeds...
verify(bird.fly()).wasCalled()  // ...this also succeeds
```

#### Methods with Parameters

[Argument matching](#argument-matching) for verification follows the same syntax as stubbing.

```swift
verify(bird.canChirp(volume: any())).wasCalled()     // Called with any volume
verify(bird.canChirp(volume: notNil())).wasCalled()  // Called with any non-nil volume
verify(bird.canChirp(volume: 10)).wasCalled()        // Called with volume = 10
```

#### Properties

Verify property invocations using their getter and setter methods.

```swift
verify(bird.getName()).wasCalled()
verify(bird.setName(any())).wasCalled()
```

#### Specific Number of Invocations

It’s possible to verify that an invocation was called a specific number of times with a count matcher.

```swift
verify(bird.fly()).wasNeverCalled()            // n = 0
verify(bird.fly()).wasCalled(exactly(10))      // n = 10
verify(bird.fly()).wasCalled(atLeast(10))      // n ≥ 10
verify(bird.fly()).wasCalled(atMost(10))       // n ≤ 10
verify(bird.fly()).wasCalled(between(5...10))  // 5 ≤ n ≤ 10
```

Count matchers also support chaining and negation using logical operators.

```swift
verify(bird.fly()).wasCalled(not(exactly(10)))           // n ≠ 10
verify(bird.fly()).wasCalled(exactly(10).or(atMost(5)))  // n = 10 || n ≤ 5
```

#### Argument Capturing

Sometimes you need to perform custom checks on argument values by using an argument captor.

```swift
let nameCaptor = ArgumentCaptor<String>()
verify(bird.setName(nameCaptor.matcher)).wasCalled()
assert(nameCaptor.value?.hasPrefix("R"))
```

#### Ordered Invocations

To enforce the relative order of invocations, use an `inOrder` block.

```swift
// Verify that `fly` was called before `chirp`
inOrder {
  verify(bird.fly()).wasCalled()
  verify(bird.chirp()).wasCalled()
}
```

Pass options to ordered verification blocks for stricter checks with additional invariants.

```swift
inOrder(with: .noInvocationsAfter) {
  verify(bird.fly()).wasCalled()
  verify(bird.chirp()).wasCalled()
}
```

#### Asynchronous Verification

You can test asynchronous code by using an `eventually` block which returns an `XCTestExpectation`. 

```swift
DispatchQueue.main.async {
  Tree(with: bird).shake()
}
let expectation = eventually {
  verify(bird.fly()).wasCalled()
  verify(bird.chirp()).wasCalled()
}
wait(for: [expectation], timeout: 1.0)
```

#### Disambiguating Overloaded Return Types

For methods overloaded by return type, you should help the compiler by specifying the type returned.

```swift
protocol Bird {
  func getMessage<T>() -> T
  func getMessage() -> String
  func getMessage() -> StaticString
}

verify(bird.getMessage()).returning(String.self).wasCalled()
```

### Resetting Mocks

Occasionally it’s necessary to remove stubs or clear recorded invocations.

```swift
reset(bird)                    // Removes all stubs, values, and invocations
clearStubs(on: bird)           // Only removes stubs
clearDefaultValues(on: bird)   // Only removes default values
clearInvocations(on: bird)     // Only removes recorded invocations
```

### Argument Matching

Argument matching allows you to handle parameterized methods for stubbing or verification.

#### Exact Value

Match specific values by passing a concrete instance. The parameter type must explicitly conform to `Equatable` or
the arguments will be compared by reference.

```swift
// Many Swift standard library types such as `String` conform to `Equatable`
verify(bird.setName("Ryan")).wasCalled()

// Types that explicitly conform to `Equatable` work out of the box
struct Fruit: Equatable {
  let size: Int
}
verify(bird.eat(Fruit(size: 42))).wasCalled()

// Classes can be safely compared by reference
class Tree {
  init(with bird: Bird) {
    bird.home = self
  }
}
let tree = Tree(with: bird)
verify(bird.setHome(tree)).wasCalled()
```

#### Wildcard and Non-Equatable Matching

Argument matchers allow wildcard and custom matching of arguments that don’t conform to `Equatable`.

```swift
any()                    // Matches any value
any(of: 1, 2, 3)         // Matches any value in {1, 2, 3}
any(where: { $0 > 42 })  // Matches any number greater than 42
notNil()                 // Matches any non-nil value
```

For methods overloaded by parameter type (such as with generics), using a matcher may cause ambiguity for 
the compiler. You can help the compiler by specifying an explicit type in the matcher.

```swift
any(Int.self)
any(Int.self, of: 1, 2, 3)
any(Int.self, where: { $0 > 42 })
notNil(String?.self)
```

You can also match elements or keys within collection types.

```swift
any(containing: 1, 2, 3)  // Matches any collection with values {1, 2, 3}
any(keys: "a", "b", "c")  // Matches any dictionary with keys {"a", "b", "c"}
any(count: atMost(42))    // Matches any collection with at most 42 elements
notEmpty()                // Matches any non-empty collection
```

#### Floating Point Values

Mathematical operations on floating point numbers can cause unexpected behavior, so consider using `around` to
fuzzily match floating point arguments with some tolerance.

```swift
around(10.0, tolerance: 0.01)
```

## Supporting Source Files

Mockingbird relies on parsing source files to generate mocked methods and properties. However, types defined
outside of your project such as in system frameworks or in a CocoaPod dependency are considered external and
cannot be parsed directly. Not having access to all sources can result in compiler errors when inheriting from an
external type.

Supporting source files allow you to provide external sources to the generator so that it can resolve inherited methods
and properties correctly. Note that it does not allow you to
[generate mocks for external types](https://github.com/birdrides/mockingbird/wiki/Mocking-External-Types).

### Starter Pack

Mockingbird includes starter supporting source files for the Swift standard library and common system frameworks
such as `Foundation`. Download the latest
[starter supporting source files](https://github.com/birdrides/mockingbird/releases/download/0.11.1/MockingbirdSupport.zip)
and place the `MockingbirdSupport` folder in the root directory of your project. Note that supporting source files
should not be imported into Xcode or added to any targets.

<details><summary>Upcoming changes in Mockingbird 0.12.0</summary>

Download the starter supporting source files for basic compatibility with the Swift standard library and common
system frameworks. Note that supporting source files should not be imported into Xcode or added to any targets.

```bash
$ mockingbird download starter-pack
```

</details>

### Adding Files

Add supporting source files whenever a mock that inherits from an external type does not compile. For example, let’s
say the mock for `protocol BirdBrain: StorageDelegate {}` does not compile because it inherits from the
external type `StorageDelegate` defined in the framework `LossyStorage`.

```swift
/// A delegate defined in `LossyStorage`
public protocol StorageDelegate: AnyObject {
  func store<T: Codable>(memory: T)
}
```

In order to generate the method `store(memory:)` for `BirdBrain`, we need to copy the definition for
`StorageDelegate` into a supporting source file for `LossyStorage`. A good place might be 
`MockingbirdSupport/LossyStorage/StorageDelegate.swift`. File names are arbitrary, but the parent
directory must have the same name as the module declaring the external type.

```swift
/// Copied into `MockingbirdSupport/LossyStorage/StorageDelegate.swift`
public protocol StorageDelegate: AnyObject {
  func store<T: Codable>(memory: T)
}
```
